## Description

The Pokedex project is a dynamic web application that serves as a comprehensive Pokemon encyclopedia. Users can effortlessly access detailed information about various Pokemon, including their health, strength, weight, and fighting capabilities. 
Built using ```React```, ```Redux```, and ```Firebase```, this project showcases the seamless integration of these technologies. 
React provides a robust user interface, Redux ensures efficient state management.
Firebase enhances the application with user authentication and real-time data updates. 
It's a showcase of my proficiency in modern web development and the successful application of these technologies to create an interactive and visually appealing frontend project.

## What did I learn ?
State Management: The project allowed me to master Redux for state management, enabling efficient data flow and organization across components.

Firebase Integration: I learned how to seamlessly integrate Firebase for user authentication and real-time data storage, enhancing the application's functionality.

Frontend Best Practices: I became proficient in front-end development best practices, optimizing performance and code structure.

Problem-Solving: Complex challenges, such as real-time updates and data synchronization, sharpened my problem-solving skills.

Project Management: I improved my project planning and organization abilities, ensuring timely completion and successful deployment.

User Experience: Understanding user needs and preferences was crucial in creating an engaging and user-friendly application.

## Installation
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
